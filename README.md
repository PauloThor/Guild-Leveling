## About

Guild Leveling is a quest-driven game based on a todo list. Every player can complete or abandon quests, progress their level, rank and roles according to which guild they are part of. They have the ability to purchase game expansions (mocked up), create or join guilds and achieve the end-game stages of Guild Leveling: the rank S quests!
